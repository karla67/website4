<ul> Types of presintations
<p> There are many ways to give a presintation you ust have to know which one goes with what your presinting, you also want to keep in mind the type of people going to your presintation and what will appeal to them<p/>
  <li> First type of presintation is the slide show.This prisntation is simple and its the most common,  its use to visual represtintations of something and you can choose the color of the background which is what will catch the attention of most audince.It will aslo help you give more information to your audince with uout you having to say it all and you can look at it from time to time.</li>
  <li>second way is to have note card.Using note card will help you fcous on the main points and you wont' have to be looking at a screen all the time and they also work for props. You can keep them in your hands and that way you dont figit with your hands.</li>
    <li>Third way to give a presintation is to have a poster.With a poster you can have an explanitation to what your doing but you need to be reading what its says because most of your audince won't be able to read it and your writing must be neat in order to be readable </li>

<ol> Body language <img src="body.jpg">
  <li>posture:stand straight and be moving all the time </li>
    <li>Eyes:If the room is small choose one person to keep your eyes on for the presintation and if the room is big with a large amount of pepople look foward or at theier foreheads</li>
      <li>Body: make sure that you move around a little and stop from time to time but dont stay in one place</li>
<li> Speech: when speaking you have to be clear and not stutter or try not to this is where the notes come in handy because if you feel like you're going to stutter or mess up a word you want to look at them and read them in your hea and then read it out loud in your normal voice though you don't want to sound like robot,you also don't want to talk to fast because then you audience won't be able to understand what you way or what you mean.</li>
  <li>The hands: use your hands to point to your main topic or have when you talk try to use your hands. DON'T BE FIDGETING WITH YOUR NAILS or the area around the nails espeacially if you have nail polish on.</li>
  <p> there are a few things that you shouldn't do in a presintation though. For example try not to yawn when talking, also try to be excited and not just nervous beause then it makes th presintation harder, you start thinking that people notice your nervious and you start to stutter.</p>
