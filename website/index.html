<img src="quote1.jpg">
<p>If you're like me then you know that speaking in public isn't your strongest suit and though your teachers and friends tell you "when you get a job you will need to speak in a big group like conferences" that just makes you freak uot more and you mentally tell yourself "you can do it!" heres a few things on how to give a presintation</p>
<p> Hardest thing to do in prestintation is getting the attention of your aduience and you have to have something that catches their attention for the whole presintation thats why i have chosen to put picutres in this website</p>

<ul> Types of presintations
    <li> First type of presintation is the slide show.This prisntation is simple and its the most common,  its use to visual represtintations of something and you can choose the color of the background which is what will catch the attention of most audince.It will aslo help you give more information to your audince with uout you having to say it all and you can look at it from time to time.</li>
  <li>second way is to have note card.Using note card will help you fcous on the main points and you wont' have to be looking at a screen all the time and they also work for props. You can keep them in your hands and that way you dont figit with your hands.</li>
    <li>Third way to give a presintation is to have a poster.With a poster you can have an explanitation to what your doing but you need to be reading what its says because most of your audince won't be able to read it and your writing must be neat in order to be readable </li>
      </ul>
<body>
<ol> BODY LANGAUGE
  <li>posture:stand straight back and move around from time to time but don't stand in front of the screen because you will not allow your audience will not be able to see </li>
    <li>Eyes:If the room is small choose one person to keep your eyes on for the presintation and if the room is big with a large amount of pepople look foward or at theier foreheads</li>
      <li>Body: make sure that you move around a little and stop from time to time but dont stay in one place</li>
<li> Speech: when speaking you have to be clear and not stutter or try not to this is where the notes come in handy because if you feel like you're going to stutter or mess up a word you want to look at them and read them in your hea and then read it out loud in your normal voice though you don't want to sound like robot,you also don't want to talk to fast because then you audience won't be able to understand what you way or what you mean.</li>
  <li>The hands: use your hands to point to your main topic or have when you talk try to use your hands.If you can have some type of prop like notes</li>
</ol>
<p>remeber that not everything will go your way there will be people who will want to embarrass you. they will ask questions that you weren't prepared to answer and you have to think quick but you can also answer that with another question or you can make it into a joke or turn it around back to them</p>
