<img src="quote1.jpg">
<p>If you're like me then you know that speaking in public isn't your strongest suit and though your teachers and friends tell you "when you get a job you will need to speak in a big group like conferences" that just makes you freak uot more and you mentally tell yourself "you can do it!" heres a few things on how to give a presintation</p>
  <img src="attention catcher.jpg">
    <p> First thing you need to know about giving presintations is that it helps with busissness,and it s important that you don't mess up because peopple will make fun of you because some people like to be mean but also you need to know that you are the only person who can mess it up for yourselfbecause your audicence doesn't know what you are going to say or if you forgot to say something only you do <p>

<ol> BODY LANGAUGE
  <li>posture:stand straight back and move around from time to time but don't stand in front of the screen because you will not allow your audience will not be able to see </li>
    <li>Eyes:If the room is small choose one person to keep your eyes on for the presintation and if the room is big with a large amount of pepople look foward or at their foreheads (as i am doing right now)</li>
      <li>Body: make sure that you move around a little and stop from time to time but dont stay in one place</li>
<li> Speech: when speaking you have to be clear and not stutter or try not to this is where the notes come in handy because if you feel like you're going to stutter or mess up a word you want to look at them and read them in your hea and then read it out loud in your normal voice though you don't want to sound like robot,you also don't want to talk to fast because then you audience won't be able to understand what you way or what you mean.</li>
  <li>The hands: use your hands to point to your main topic or have when you talk try to use your hands.If you can have some type of prop like notes</li>
</ol>
<p>remeber that not everything will go your way there will be people who will want to embarrass you. they will ask questions that you weren't prepared to answer and you don't have to come up with the answer real quick you can answer that with another question or you can make it into a joke,turn it around back to them,tell them to save the question so it can be answered later.There's also going to be people who like to make fun of your mistakes while presanting but you also joke around with them and dont take things serious.</p>
