  <tittle>The way to give a good presentation.</title>
<p>If you're like me then you know that speaking in public isn't your strongest suit and though your teachers and friends tell you "when you get a job you will need to speak in a big group like conferences" that just makes you freak out more and you mentally you tell yourself "you can do it!" and even if you feel like you can't do it but your forced to any way here's a few things on how to give a presentation</p>
<p> Hardest thing to do in prestentation is getting the attention of your audience and you have to have something that catches their attention for the whole presentation that's why I have chosen to put pictures in this website. Pictures are a good way to get attention because people will automatically look at them so try to get pictures but also don't put too many picture because people will pay more attention to the pictures than they will to you. Also you not might need picture but they're a good refernce for like charts and jokes.</p>

    <p> First thing you need to know about giving presentations is that it helps with busissness, and it's important that you don't mess up because people will make fun of you because some people like to be mean but also you need to know that you are the only person who can mess it up for yourself because your audience doesn't know what you are going to say or if you forgot to say something only you do <p>

<ol> BODY LANGAUGE
  <li>posture: stand straight back and move around from time to time but don't stand in front of the screen because you will not allow your audience will not be able to see </li>
    <li>Eyes: If the room is small choose one person to keep your eyes on for the presentation and if the room is big with a large amount of people look forward or at their foreheads (as i am doing right now)</li>
      <li>Body: make sure that you move around a little and stop from time to time but don't stay in one place</li>
<li> Speech: when speaking you have to be clear and try not to stutter and if you feel like you're going to stutter take a deep breath and think of the word and just slowly say it this is where the notes come in handy because if you feel like you're going to stutter or mess up a word you want to look at them and read them in your head and then read it out loud in your normal voice, but also speak normally you don't want to sound like robot, you also don't want to talk to fast because then you audience won't be able to understand what you way</li>
  <li>The hands:this is where you're like"What am i suppose to to with them".For a presintation use your hands to point to your main topic or have when you talk try to use your hands.If you can have some type of prop like notes</li>
</ol>
<p>remeber that not everything will go your way there will be people who will want to embarrass you. they will ask questions that you weren't prepared to answer and you don't have to come up with the answer fast you can answer that with another question or you can make it into a joke,turn it around back to them,tell them to save the question so it can be answered later.There's also going to be people who like to make fun of your mistakes while presanting but you also joke around with them and dont take things serious.</p>
<p> The main thing that you should learn from this is when giving a speech you should have some sticky notes or at least some type of notes and don't write a whole paragraph just a small sentece or one word that'll help you remember what it s you're going to say always remember this no one but you can mess this up no one else knows what is going on in your head or what your going to say so you can say whatever and start where ever you want</p>
